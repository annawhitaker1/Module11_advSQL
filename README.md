PART 1
    In part one, I scraped the title and teaser for each artical on the Mars news URL and listed out the results. 
PART 2
    In part two, I scraped the mars information data from the url provided and created a pandas dataframe. Once the dataframe was created, we updated the data types to support data analytics with the information that was scraped. With the updated data types, I was able to perform some basic analytics around unique months, unique sols, average minimum temperature, average pressure, and minimum temperature over the Martian year. The results are shown in detail in the code. 
    At the end, I wrote the dataframe to a csv file and saved that in my repository.
